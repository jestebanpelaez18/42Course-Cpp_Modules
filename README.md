# C++ Modules

Welcome to C++ modules. A series of 35 exercises designed to introduce Object-Oriented Programming in C++. Each module delves into different aspects of C++ programming, offering a comprehensive understanding of the language. The content ranges from basic topics like C++ syntax to more complex and challenging concepts such as containers

## Content

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Module List](#modulelist)

## Installation 

Firts clone this repository in your current working directory.
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/jestebanpelaez18/42Course-Cpp_Modules.git
```

Then go to the folder of the desire module and then to the desire folder exercise. For example:

```bash
  cd cpp00
  cd ex00
```

Each exercise has a Makefile, which you can use to compile the exercise. Use this command for compiling the exercise:

```bash
  make
```
And finally run the executable:

```bash
  ./executable_name
```

Depend of the exercise and the goal of it, each has a main with different Tests.
